This project aims to optimize inventory management for OList, an e-commerce company, by analyzing historical sales data to identify top-selling products responsible for 80% of the revenue and customer purchase behavior through Market Basket Analysis.

I have built a Tableau Workbook that highlights all the key findings. To view it, click [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/OlistDashboard_17100676596960/Top20products?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)! 

Methodologies:  
* Aggregated and prepped years worth of sales data for modelling 
* Performed univariate and outlier analysis
* Used association and Apriori algorithm to do Market Basket Analysis and generated frequent item sets. Calculated lift.
